Repository for the currently 'Unnamed' Game (called Wizards for now)

Files should allow a user to open the current Unity project.

Unity Version: 2018.3.5f1

Setup Guide:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using some Git graphical software or command line. I am currently using GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/

2. Download Unity Hub

3. Install the current Unity Version (listed above) using Unity Hub. Download located at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

4. Choose to open an existing Unity project and select the folder where you cloned the Git respository.

5. Open the project, open the MainScene in Assets/Scenes, and hit the play button at the top.

Note: You probably need Visual Studio installed on your local computer for the C# code to correctly open and compile. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
